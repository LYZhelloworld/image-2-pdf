# image-2-pdf
Compile your images into PDF files.

# Usage
`img2pdf.py <directory that contains images> [<directory2 that contains images> ...]`

You can drag and drop folders onto the script.

In case your OS does not support Python file dragging and dropping, use the batch script `go.bat` instead.
